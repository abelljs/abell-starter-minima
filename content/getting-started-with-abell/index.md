# {{ Abell.meta.title }}

Abell is a static site generator that lets you create blog in just few clicks without writing any code. 

Abell can be customized without any knowledge of JavaScript frameworks. You just have to edit HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make changes in the blog.

## Create your blog

Create your blog in one button click!!

<a 
  style="border-radius: 6px;font-size: 11pt; padding:10px 20px;background-color: #353D3E; color: #ffffff;" 
  href="https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/abelljs/abell-starter-minima"> 
  Create and Deploy Blog to Netlify <img style="position: relative; top: 5px;left: 3px;" alt="netlify logo" width="20" src="./assets/netlify.svg">
</a>

This will create a new project in your GitHub and will deploy it to Netlify. Later you can make changes in the blog by editing files in your new GitHub project.

*or*

you can create project locally with,
```sh
npx create-abell-app my-cool-blog
```

## Writing blog

After deployment, a repository will be created on your GitHub account. You can edit files in `content` directory to edit blog and create a new folder with `index.md` to create new blog.
